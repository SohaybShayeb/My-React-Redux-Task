Hello there.
before you can run the app, you need to
extract the file called MyApp first,
then use the command 'npm install' to 
install all node modules and so,then
after the installation is completed 
you need to use the command 'npm start'.
In case it doesn't work you can
contact me at:
sohaib.f.shayeb@gmail.com

the directories:
actions: contains the actions creators
AppCostants: contains all actions types, in case you miss typed some  of them
components: contains the main components
reducers: contains the reducers
ReducersHelper: check for fake auth
routers: contains the routes and so
styles: contains the styles of all components
the provider is at the main index.js

I hope you like it !!
